%% 2D Robot Localization - Tutorial
% This tutorial introduces the main aspects of *UKF-M*.
%
% Goals of this script:
% 
% * understand the main principles of Unscented Kalman Filtering on Manifolds
%   (*UKF-M*) [BBB19].
% * get familiar with the implementation.
% * design an UKF for a vanilla 2D robot localization problem.
%
% _We assume the reader to have sufficient prior knowledge with (unscented)
% Kalman filtering. However, we require really approximate prior knowledge
% and intuition about manifolds and tangent spaces._
%
% This tutorial describes all one require to design an Unscented Kalman Filter
% (UKF) on a (parallelizable) manifold, and puts in evidence the versatility and
% simplicity of the method in term of implementation. Indeed, we need to define
% an UKF on parallelizable manifolds:
% 
% # a *model* of the state-space system that specifies the propagation and 
%   measurement functions of the system.
% # an *uncertainty representation* of the estimated state, which is a mapping 
%   that generalizes the linear uncertainty definition $e = x - \hat{x}$.
% # standard UKF parameters that are noise covariance matrices and sigma point
%   parameters.
% 
% We introduce the methodology by addressing the vanilla problem of robot
% localization, where the robot obtains velocity measurements, e.g., from wheel
% odometry, and position measurements, e.g., from GPS. The state consists of the
% robot orientation along with the 2D robot position. We reproduce the example
% described in [BB17], Section IV.

%% Initialization
% Start by cleaning the workspace. Be also sure that all paths have been added,
% otherwise launch importukfm.m.

%% The Model
% The first ingredient we need is a *model* that defines:
%
% # the state of the system at instant $n$, noted $\chi_n \in \mathcal{M}$, 
%   where $\mathcal{M}$ is a parallelizable  manifold (vectors spaces, Lie 
%   groups and others). Here the state corresponds to the robot orientation and 
%   the robot position.
% # a propagation function that describes how the state evolves along time.
% # an observation function describing the measures we have.

%%
% We first define the model parameters.

% sequence time (s)
T = 40; 
% odometry frequency (Hz)
odo_freq = 100; 
% odometry noise standard deviation
odo_noise_std = [0.01;  % longitudinal speed (v/m)
    0.01;               % transversal shift speed (v/m)
    1/180*pi];          % differential odometry (rad/s)
% GPS frequency (Hz)
gps_freq = 1;
% GPS noise standard deviation (m)
gps_noise_std = 1;
% radius of the circle trajectory (m)
radius = 5;
% total number of timestamps
N = T*odo_freq;
% integration step (s)
dt = 1/odo_freq;

%% Simulating the Model
% We compute simulated data, where the robot drives along a 10 m diameter circle
% for 40 seconds with high rate odometer measurements (100 Hz) and low rate
% position measurements (1 Hz). We obtain the true states along with noisy
% inputs.

[states, omegas] = localization_simu_f(T, odo_freq, odo_noise_std, radius);

%%
% The state and input are both array of structures. One can access to there
% values to a specific instant n as:
%
%   state = states(n)
%   omega = omegas(n)
%
% We can then access to the elements of the state or the input as:
%
%   states(n).Rot         % 2d orientation encoded in a rotation matrix
%   states(n).p           % 2d position
%   omegas(n).v           % robot forward velocity
%   omegas(n).gyro        % robot angular velocity 
%
% The elements of the state and the input depend on the considered problem,
% where we encode the orientation in a rotation matrix. In all our examples, we
% define orientations in matrices living in $SO(2)$ and $SO(3)$.
%
% You can look at the localization folder to see the model function.
%
% With the _true_ state trajectory, we simulate _noisy_ measurements.

[ys, one_hot_ys] = localization_simu_h(states, T, odo_freq, gps_freq, ...
    gps_noise_std);

%%
% $\mathtt{ys}$ is a matrix that contains all the observations. To get the k-th
% measurement, take the k-th column as:
%
%   y = ys(:, k)
%
% We have defined an array $\mathtt{one\_hot\_y}$ that containts 1 at instant
% where a measurement happens and 0 otherwise.

%% Filter Design and Initialization
% Designing an UKF on parallelizable manifolds consists in:
%
% # defining a model of the propagation function and the measurement function.
% # choosing the retraction $\varphi(.,.)$ and inverse retraction
%   $\varphi^{-1}_.(.)$ such that $\chi = \varphi(\hat{\chi}, \xi)$,
%   $\xi  = \varphi^{-1}(\chi, \hat{\chi})$, where $\chi$ is the true state,
%   $\hat{\chi}$ the estimated state, and $\xi$ the state uncertainty (we does
%   not use notation $x$ and $e$ to emphasize the differences with the linear 
%   case).
% # setting UKF parameters such as sigma point dispersion and noise covariance
%   values.
%
% Step 1) is already done, as we take the functions defined in the model.
%
% Step 2) consists in choosing the mapping that encodes our representation of
% the state belief. A basic UKF is building on the uncertainty defined as $e = x
% - \hat{x}$, which is not necessary optimal. Rather than, we define the
% uncertainty $\xi$  thought $\chi = \varphi(\hat{\chi}, \xi)$, where the
% _retraction_ $\varphi(.,.)$ has to satisfy $\varphi(\chi, \mathbf{0}) =
% \chi$ (without uncertainty, the estimated state equals the true state). We
% then need an _inverse retraction_ to get a difference from two states that
% must respect $\varphi^{-1}_{\chi}(\chi) = \mathbf{0}$.
%
% We embed here the state in $SO(2) \times R^2$, such that:
%
% * the retraction $\varphi(.,.)$ is the $SO(2)$ exponential for orientation
%   and the vector addition for position.
%
% * the inverse retraction  $\varphi^{-1}_.(.)$ is the $SO(2)$ logarithm for
%   orientation and the vector subtraction for position.
%
% _One can suggest alternative retractions, e.g. by viewing the state as a
% element of $SE(2)$. In the benchmarks folder, we compare different choices of
% retraction for different problems._
%
% We know define UKF parameters, where we consider an innacurate initial heading
% estimation of 1°. We set the remaining filter parameters as in the model.

% propagation noise covariance matrix
Q = diag(odo_noise_std.^2);
% measurement noise covariance matrix
R = gps_noise_std.^2 * eye(2);
% initial uncertainty matrix
P0 = zeros(3, 3); 
% The state is not perfectly initialized
P0(1, 1) = (1/180*pi)^2;
alpha = [1e-3, 1e-3, 1e-3];
% this parameter scales the sigma points. Current values are betwenn 10^-3 and 1

% define the UKF propagation and measurement functions
f = @localization_f;
h = @localization_h;
phi = @localization_phi;
phi_inv = @localization_phi_inv;
% get UKF weight parameters
weights = ukf_set_weight(3, 2, alpha);
% compute Cholewski decomposition of Q only once
cholQ = chol(Q);

%%
% We initialize the filter with the true state with a small error heading of 1°.

ukf_state = states(1);
% "add" orientation error to the initial state
ukf_state.Rot = ukf_state.Rot * so2_exp(sqrt(P0(1, 1)));
ukf_P = P0;

% set variables for recording estimates along the full trajectory
ukf_states = ukf_state;
ukf_Ps = zeros(N, length(ukf_P), length(ukf_P));
ukf_Ps(1, :, :) = ukf_P;

%% Filtering
% The UKF proceeds as a standard Kalman filter with a for loop.

% measurement iteration number (first measurement is for n == 1)
k = 2;
for n = 2:N
    % propagation
    [ukf_state, ukf_P] = ukf_propagation(ukf_state, ukf_P, omegas(n-1), ...
        f, dt, phi, phi_inv, cholQ, weights);
    % update only if a measurement is received
    if one_hot_ys(n) == 1
        [ukf_state, ukf_P] = ukf_update(ukf_state, ukf_P, ys(:, k), ...
            h, phi, R, weights);
        k = k + 1;
    end
    eig(ukf_P)
    % save estimates
    ukf_states(n) = ukf_state;
    ukf_Ps(n, :, :) = ukf_P;
end

%% Results
% We plot the trajectory, GPS measurements and estimated trajectory. We then
% plot the orientation and position errors along with 95% ($3\sigma$) confident
% interval. The results has to be confirmed with average metrics to reveal the
% filter performances in term of accuracy, consistency and robustness.

localization_results_plot(ukf_states, ukf_Ps, states, dt, ys);

%%
% All results seem coherent. This is expected as the initial heading error is
% small.

%% Conclusion
% This script introduces UKF-M and shows how designing an UKF on parallelizable
% manifolds mainly consists in choosing an advantageous uncertainty
% representation. Two major interests of the method are that many problems could
% be addressed within the framework, and that both the theory and its
% implementation are sufficiently simple.
%
% The filter works apparently well on a simple robot localization problem, with
% small initial heading error. Is it hold for more challenging initial error ?
%
% You can now:
%
% * enter more in depth with the theory, see [BBB19].
% * address the UKF for the same problem with different noise parameters, and 
%   even test its robustness to strong initial heading error.
% * modify the propagation model with a differential odometry model, where
%   inputs are left and right wheel speed measurements.
% * apply the UKF for the same problem on real data.
% * benchmark the UKF with different retractions and compare the new filters to
%   both the extended Kalman filter and invariant extended Kalman filter of 
%   [BB17].
